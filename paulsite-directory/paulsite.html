      <h2>DREXEL UNIVERSITY</h2>
        <p2>
            I am currently Sophomore at Drexel Univeristy in University City, Philadelphia. I'm studying Computing and Security Technology (CST) as part of the university's five year program. I initially entered Drexel as a Compuer Science major, but as I was selecting classes, I gained an appreciation for the field of Cybersecurity and switched my major to focus on that area of study.</p1>
        <br></br>
        As of writing, I have made the Dean's list twice between five semesters, and I currently have earned a cumulative 3.7 grade point average.
        <br></br>
        I am a member of the Gamma Chi chapter of Delta Sigma Phi Fraterntiy. Delta Sigma Phi has provided me with unique leadership experiences, inlcuding training alongside my fraternity's Secretary during my freshman year. At the beginning of my Sophomore year, I was chosen by fraternity leadership to head the position of President of Residental Management. In this role, I'm in charge of keeping our chapter house stocked with supplies, organizing training sessions between Drexel personnel and our brotherhood, being a direct line of contact to Drexel Housing and Residency, and updating all documents regarding residents of our house.
